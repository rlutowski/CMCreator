                        CM Creator Installation and Execution

File Format Notes
-----------------
1. On Linux, all files with a .txt extension can be read using a text
   editor, including this file.

2. Data files in the dgdata directory ending in .geo are binary data
   files and are not suitable for viewing with a text editor or any
   other program other than CM Creator.


Java Installation
-----------------

1. Check if a Java Developmet Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment
   (JRE) is installed on your system by opening a command line window,
   then typing the command: 
     java -version

   The response should be similar to
     > java -version
     java version "1.8.0_152"
     Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-b16)
     Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.152-b16, mixed mode)

2. If the response is something like "command not found", then download 
   a JDK or JRE version 8 or later from

     https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

   and install per the instructions.

3. Repeat step 1 to be sure it is installed correctly.
